## Installation and Usage

### Native Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS1 Noetic

If you have ROS1 installed natively, you should first install `mrs-uav-system` from [here](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_system).
Then, you can follow the instruction from the `installation/native_ubuntu-20.04/README.md` folder of this repository.
Please write to us if you face any issues.

### Ubuntu 24.04 with ROS1 Noetic in MRS Apptainer

The following guide assumes that you do not have native ROS1 packages and you have a newer Linux (probably Ubuntu 24.04) installed.  
You should first install [MRS Apptainer](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_apptainer) by following the instructions in its README.  
Then, you can follow the instruction from the `installation/mrs_apptainer/README.md` folder of this repository.
